# Hues Of You: A 2D Interactive Animated Short Film

Color is one of the factors that contribute to the life of any object. The colors are the first thing that someone notices when they look at a piece of art. However, if the eyes are damaged in any way, whether physically or chemically, or as a result of inherited genes from the parents, faulty photo pigments in the eyes will result in color deficiency or color blindness (WebMD, 2021). 

The result of this study would help people who were color-blind understand and distinguish the colors in the film. The short film discussed color-blind people's experiences, different types of color blindness, love, and friendship. 

This study aimed to create a 2D interactive animated short film that was color-blind friendly.
Specifically, this study aims to:
1. Create a two-dimensional animated short film that highlighted the peculiarities of two-dimensional people and objects while also being color-blind-friendly for various degrees of color-blindness (Protanopia, Deuteranopia, and Tritanopia).
2. Create an interactive system in the short film that allowed the viewer to select his or her color blindness type, offered preset color palettes for all types of color blindness, and modified the color palette of the characters and objects based on the viewer's color blindness type.
3. Identify key scenarios for color-blind people through data gathering and integrate them in the story of the short film.
4. Develop a viewer evaluation module within the interactive media system to determine the film's effectiveness as a color-blind-friendly film.

Each one of the objectives were successfully tackled, and given solutions.
